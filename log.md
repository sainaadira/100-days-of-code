**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday October 28,2019

**Today's Progress**: Explored morgan.js and express.js. I also learned how to create and use middleware and worked with HTTP request codes.

**Thoughts** I am getting back into coding more consistently. I had to refresh my memory with middleware and HTTP request codes but I am feeling more comfortable with understanding how middleware works and the importance of utilizing middleware with node.js.
