**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday October 28,2019

**Today's Progress**: Explored morgan.js and express.js. I also learned how to create and use middleware and worked with HTTP request codes.

**Thoughts** I am getting back into coding more consistently. I had to refresh my memory with middleware and HTTP request codes but I am feeling more comfortable with understanding how middleware works and the importance of utilizing middleware with node.js.



### Day 1: Tuesday October 29,2019

**Today's Progress**: I read a chapter on functions from JSway on Github. I waned to refresh my memory on the importance of functions regarding algorithmic thinking. I also completed an 8kyu codewar challenge. 

**Thoughts** I am happy to refresh my memory today. It was a reminder of what I already knew and areas I needed to brush up on. I played around with code jsbin as well. I think overall, my biggest challenge with programming was the fear of messing up. I am really working on being patient with myself, reading and working through what I don't understanding and figuring out how to apply what I've learned in later challenges.
