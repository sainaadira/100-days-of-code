##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: Monday October 28,2019

**Today's Progress**: Explored morgan.js and express.js. I also learned how to create and use middleware and worked with HTTP request codes.

**Thoughts** I am getting back into coding more consistently. I had to refresh my memory with middleware and HTTP request codes but I am feeling more comfortable with understanding how middleware works and the importance of utilizing middleware with node.js.



### Day 2: Tuesday October 29,2019

**Today's Progress**: I read a chapter on functions from JSway on Github. I waned to refresh my memory on the importance of functions regarding algorithmic thinking. I also completed an 8kyu codewar challenge.

**Thoughts** I am happy to refresh my memory today. It was a reminder of what I already knew and areas I needed to brush up on. I played around with code jsbin as well. I think overall, my biggest challenge with programming was the fear of messing up. I am really working on being patient with myself, reading and working through what I don't understanding and figuring out how to apply what I've learned in later challenges.


### Day 3: Wednesday October 30,2019

**Today's Progress**: I watched a video on Youtube (coding train) objects. I also revisited a coding problem I solved 2 months ago. I worked with nested objects and arrays and iterating through nested objects.

**Thoughts** It felt good to revisit an old coding problem, especially one that I had trouble with solving. I would like to work more with objects and OOP with JavaScript. I dedicated an hour to studying today (as I will everyday) but I feel like I did not accomplish as much as I wanted to. However, I am happy with what I did accomplish and I look forward to reading and watching tutorials on OOP.



### Day 4:Thursday October 31,2019

**Today's Progress**: I did some challenges on freecodecamp's Data Structures and Algorithms. I am hoping to complete all of the challenges and earn the certification. I also completed a codewar challenge.

**Thoughts** I am working towards studying for at least an hour every day. I don't realise how fast an hour goes by when I am reading and working on challenges. I think I want to set up a lesson plan so there's more structure in what I am teaching myself. I am happy that I've been studying consistently and I hope to eventually move on to building applications but I am glad to be taking baby steps.

### Day 5: Friday November 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I read an articles about making web applications using Express.js and Node.js and MongoDB.  I read another article on CRUD functionality for full stack web applications. Lastly, I worked through some challenges on freecodecamp. This weekend I plan to walk through CRUD article again and code along with it so I can have a better understanding of server-side programming and sending/storing data with MongoDB.

**Thoughts** I want to take my time learning how to work with server-side web applications. My goal is to finish building a full stack web application that I started this summer. My plan is to start over again and really focus on understanding how to build an app using Mongo DB as my database. I struggled a lot in trying to build it the first time but I want to use the 100 days of code challenge to truly help me complete this app on my own (or with very little guidance.)

### Day 6: Saturday November 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent an hour coding along to the CRUD article. I did not finish it but I am happy to stick to the hour of reading or coding that I've been doing since starting the challenge. I plan on taking my time to get through the article and really fill in the gaps that did not make sense to me when I first worked with server-side programming.

**Thoughts** Consistency and baby steps. That's what I want to focus on when programming. It may take me a while but I don't care.. as long as I get there.


### Day 7: Sunday November 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I spent an hour coding along to the CRUD article. I was able to create a database and store data into it on MongdoDB. A challenge that I was faced with was getting the data stored in Mongo to display to the user. I will spend more time working through that challenge tomorrow.

**Thoughts** I view challenges a little differently now. I want to take my time to understand what is not working and why it's not working instead of being frustrated at the challenge. I am really trying to take babysteps with learning how to program and what to do when challenges arise.


### Day 8: Monday November 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I continued working on the CRUD tutorial and got stuck on the same issue of displaying to the DOM. even after following the steps verbatim. I'm getting errors in the console that aren't even in my code..so learning to ask for help is major. Noted.

**Thoughts**  I am working on getting help and not being afraid to ask for help. But first I want to learn to try to solve things on my own for a while.

### Day 9: Tuesday November 5, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I'm committing to an hour of code every day. If not programming, then reading articles/books or something productive. i worked on #freeCodeCamp's js data structures and algorithms. I'm also going to be working with a mentor for more structure.

**Thoughts**  I am happy to work with more structure but I am also happy to at least commit to something that keeps me motivated to learn.


### Day 10: Wednesday November 6, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Progressing through freecodecamp and I am almost 1/2 way done with the JS Data Structures and Algorithms. I completed a codewar with two solutions. I need to work at sitting through the challenge and figuring out how to break the problem down. I still feel kind of bad for running to Google to be my savior but I also need to realise that Google is and will always be necessary throughout my programming journey.

**Thoughts**  No thoughts today. I just want to keep the motivation going.
